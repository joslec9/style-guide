            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This style guide acts as the official guide to follow in our projects. We will use this guide to review project submissions. There are many opinions on the "ideal" style in the world of Front-End Web Development. Therefore, in order to reduce the confusion on what style we should follow during the course of our projects, we urge all to refer to this style guide for their projects.</p>

            <h2>Git Cloning an Existing Repository
            </h2>
            <p> If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project you’d like to contribute to – the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important distinction – instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there – see Getting Git on a Server for more details).</p>

            <h2>Git Creating a New Branch</h2>
            <p>What happens if you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around. Let’s say you create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git branch command:
                $ git branch testing
                This creates a new pointer at the same commit you’re currently on.
                A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.
            </p>

            <h2>Commit Messages</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Message Structure</h3>
                <p>A commit messages consists of three distinct parts separated by a blank line: the title, an optional body and an optional footer. The layout looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>type: subject

body

footer</code></pre>
                <p>The title consists of the type of the message and subject.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The Type</h3>
                <p>The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>feat:</strong> a new feature</li>
                    <li><strong>fix:</strong> a bug fix</li>
                    <li><strong>docs:</strong> changes to documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>style:</strong> formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change</li>
                    <li><strong>refactor:</strong> refactoring production code</li>
                    <li><strong>test:</strong> adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change</li>
                    <li><strong>chore:</strong> updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The Subject</h3>
                <p>Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.</p>
                <p>Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use <strong>change</strong>; not changed or changes.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The Body</h3>
                <p>Not all commits are complex enough to warrant a body, therefore it is optional and only used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and context. Use the body to explain the <strong>what</strong> and <strong>why</strong> of a commit, not the how.</p>
                <p>When writing a body, the blank line between the title and the body is required and you should limit the length of each line to no more than 72 characters.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The Footer</h3>
                <p>The footer is optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Example Commit Message</h3>
                <pre><code>feat: Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, is necessary. Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789</code></pre>
