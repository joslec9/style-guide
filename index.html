            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This style guide acts as the official guide to follow in our projects. We will use this guide to review project submissions. There are many opinions on the "ideal" style in the world of Front-End Web Development. Therefore, in order to reduce the confusion on what style we should follow during the course of our projects, we urge all to refer to this style guide for their projects.</p>
            <H3>Why Standards & Style Matter</H3>
            <p>Naming and coding standards should be to provide consistency and ease of maintenance and understanding of each other’s code. That way any developer can, with as little pain as possible, begin working in any section and become familiar with it, with little effort. Naming of selectors, classes, and variables in any language should provide clear understanding as to its usage. Any front-end developer should be able to review this document and get up to speed on our naming, style, and organizational conventions.</p>
            <h3> What’s Important</h3>
            <p>Organization, consistency in naming within the project, semantically named variables, comments where they would benefit other developers, as well as when we go back and review or upgrade completed code.  </p>
            <h3>What’s Not As Important</h3>
            <p>Following the letter of the law. <b>Occasional rule breaking is forgivable, but most of this stuff is very good practice so it’s good to make it a habit.</b></p>
