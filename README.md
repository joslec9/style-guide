Restaurant Zone Style Guide
==============================

## Why Standards & Style Matter

Naming and coding standards should be to provide consistency and ease of maintenance and understanding of each other’s code. That way any developer can, with as little pain as possible, begin working in any section and become familiar with it, with little effort. Naming of selectors, classes, and variables in any language should provide clear understanding as to its usage. Any front-end developer should be able to review this document and get up to speed on our naming, style, and organizational conventions.

## What’s Important
Organization, consistency in naming within the project, semantically named variables, comments where they would benefit other developers, as well as when we go back and review or upgrade completed code. 

## What’s Not As Important
Following the letter of the law. Occasional rule breaking is forgivable, but most of this stuff is very good practice so it’s good to make it a habit. 


* Run `bower install` before working on it!*
